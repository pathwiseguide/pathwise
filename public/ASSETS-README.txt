To show cofounder photos on the homepage (About Us section):

1. Add your photo files to this folder (public/):
   - jiayue-liu.png   (for Jiayue Liu)
   - rehaan-vasudev.jpg (for Rehaan Vasudev)

2. Use any common image format (.png, .jpg, .webp). If your filenames
   are different, update the img src in index.html (search for "About Us").

Until you add the files, the site will show placeholder avatars (purple circle
with initial) so the layout still looks correct.
